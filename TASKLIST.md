# Project Task List

- [x] react-app - done
- [x] backend registration - done
- [x] backend login - done
- [ ] database - to do
- [ ] database connectivity - to do

Notes:
- Database tasks require credentials and verification; currently `application.properties` includes environment-variable fallbacks.
- Mark tasks done here after you verify the DB connection and run an end-to-end test (register → login → see user in DB).
